# Medical Image Classification with deep neural network
This file is the programmes associated to my internship in LIS laboratory in November/December 2021. There are in Python 3.8.

For my internship, the objective is to use deep neural network for classify medical images and more particularly cells images. 
The data set is composed of about 240 images. This images are taken by a smartphone and we need to modify them for our algorithm. this data set is private.

The python files are divided into two parts corresponding to the main parts of my project. The first one is the comparison of already trained neural networks and the second one is the attempt to improve the results obtained in the previous part.

In the first part, the networks used are well-known networks such as: VGG19, ResNet 50, ResNet 50 V2 and EfficientNet.
